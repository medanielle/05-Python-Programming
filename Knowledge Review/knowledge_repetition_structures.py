        b. flag
        c. signal

True or False:

    1. A condition-controlled loop always repeats a specific number of times.

    2. The while loop is a pretest loop.

    3. The following statement subtracts 1 from x: x = x - 1

    4. It is not necessary to initialize accumulator variables.

    5. In a nested loop, the inner loop goes through all of its iterations for every 
    single iteration of the outer loop.

    6. To calculate the total number of iterations of a nested loop, add the number of 
    iterations of all the loops.

    7. The process of input validation works as follows: when the user of a program enters
    invalid data, the program should ask the user “Are you sure you meant to enter that?”
    If the user answers “yes,” the program should accept the data.
