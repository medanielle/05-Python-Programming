Capital Quiz
Write a program that creates a dictionary containing the U.S. states as keys and their capitals as values. 
(Use the Internet to get a list of the states and their capitals.) The program
should then randomly quiz the user by displaying the name of a state and asking the user
to enter that stateâ€™s capital. The program should keep a count of the number of correct and
incorrect responses. (As an alternative to the U.S. states, the program can use the names of
countries and their capitals.)
