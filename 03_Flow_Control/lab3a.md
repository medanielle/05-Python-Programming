## Lab 3A

![](../.gitbook/assets/madlibs.png)

## General

Create your own mad libs game asking the user for input to fill in the blanks. Print out using .format\(\).

\(Humor encouraged\)

## Background

"Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, before reading the – often comical or nonsensical – story aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime."

## Requirments

* Adhere to PEP8 \(Comments, formatting, style, etc\)
* Create a handful of phrases that require different numbers of inputs
* Prompt the user for input\(s\):
  * Inputs can be done a number of ways... 
    * \(SIMPLE\) Ask user for input directly, tell them if the word\(s\) need to be a verb, noun, etc. 
    * \(Moderate\) Give the user a handful of choices per input to choose from. You will need to create a bank of verbs, nouns, etc for this. 
    * \(Harder\) Give the user cards based on the actual game. Allowing them to draw, etc... following the rules. Allow them to only input those cards. 
  * \(optional\) Implement basic user input checking:
    * Check to ensure words are words, numbers are numbers \(there are many ways to do this\)
    * Ensure symbols aren't used if they are not needed
    * Check length
    * etc...
    * Implement re-input if input is incorrect
* Output the user's inputs into the given phrase
* Use formatting to not only output the user inputs, but to create a UI within the terminal. Space out certain UI elements such as title of program, choices, menu deceration, etc.
