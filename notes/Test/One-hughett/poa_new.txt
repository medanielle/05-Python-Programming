Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
 can't run the race
The pace is too fast
 just won't last

 love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
 take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

 like to think you're never wrong
( live what you've learned)
 have to act like you're someone
( live what you've learned)
 want someone to hurt like you
( live what you've learned)
 want to share what you've been through
( live what you've learned)

 love the things I say I'll do
The way I'll hurt myself again just to get back at you
 take away when I give in
My life, my pride is broken

 like to think you're never wrong
( live what you've learned)
 have to act like you're someone
( live what you've learned)
 want someone to hurt like you
( live what you've learned)
 want to share what you've been through
( live what you've learned)
